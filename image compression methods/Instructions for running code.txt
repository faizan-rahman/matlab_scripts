Original images are named Lena, baboon and airplane.

The compressed Y and red channels of Lena, baboon and airplane are given by (Lena_Y1-compressor.png) and 
(Lena_red-compressor.png) and (baboon_Y1-compressor.png) and (baboon_red-compressor.png) and (airplane_Y1-compressor.png) 
and (airplane_red-compressor.png). Images named (Lena_Y1.png) and (Lena_red.png) and (baboon_Y1.png) and (baboon_red.png) and
(airplane_Y1.png) and (airplane_red.png) are compressed at (https://compressor.io) to obtain the compressed images stated above.

Code file for technique 1 (interband prediction) is named (paper1code_speckle.m)

Code file for technique 2 (hierarchical prediction) is named (paper2code_speckle.m) which utilizes a function 
named (dir_calculator.m)

To run code just run (paper1code_speckle.m) or (paper2code_speckle.m) as MATLAB script. Make sure you are in the working directory with all the
required images and helper functions.

To try baboon image in (paper1code_speckle.m) change image name in lines:

line 4: to baboon.png

line 5: to baboon.png

line 21: to baboon_red.png

line 201: to baboon_red-compressor.png

line 610: to baboon_red-compressor.png


To try baboon image in (paper2code_speckle.m) change image name in lines:

line 4: to baboon.png

line 5: to baboon.png

line 30: to baboon_Y1.png

line 351: to baboon_Y1-compressor.png

line 372: to baboon_Y1-compressor.png


Same can be done for airplane.


Final compressed images are stored in compressed_image_paper1.png and compressed_image_paper2.png for techniques 1 and
2 repectively.

Both techniques can be tested for color images of your choice! (as long as they have equal rows and columns).
